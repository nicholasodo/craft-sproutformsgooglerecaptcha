# Craft Sidebar Enhancer

With Craft 2.5 came a redesigned control panel. Although pretty, it takes a lot more clicks just to find the setting you're looking for. Not anymore! Craft Sidebar Enhancer adds extended options to Craft's existing sidebar.

Just like the gear option in previous versions of Craft, Craft Sidebar Enhancer adds both system & general options back to the central navigation - no longer requring an extra step to the 'settings' button.

### Installation
1. Download & unzip the file and place the `sidebarenhancer` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git@github.com:nicholasodo/craft-sidebarenhancer.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `sidebarenhancer` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.
